# Full Stack Ghibli Movies DB App

This repository includes a full stack app using React, Node/Express, and MySQL. This app is used for demostrating deployment steps using Heroku or Railway.

## Notes

This repo is connected currently to 2 remotes: 

- one in "annasfe" account, called *remoteAnnaGit*
- one in "heroku", created automatically when following the deployment steps and setting up the app the first time, called *heroku*.
- there was a 3rd one, the initial *origin* connected to "codeopinstructor" account, but I removed it, cause we are not using that anymore.
